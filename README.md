# Re: Launch
**A Do-it-Yourself Arduino launchpad for music production and live performance.**
#
Re: Launch is a free and open-source software for Arduino microcontrollers such as Arduino Uno, Leonardo and Pro Micro. Musicians, including me, know how expensive a commercial equipment can be and in order for more people to have easier access to music production equipments, I have made the materials as cheap as possible to obtain. As a bonus feature, you can also use this as a programmable macro pad.
